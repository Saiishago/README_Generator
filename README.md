# The README Generator!

This Project has been created in order to show/allow a user to create a well structured professional README.md file using the command line. Below you will find information about how to install it, how to use it and an image of what your end result might look like. The main reason we use README.md files is to give a user/viewer an overview of what to expect in the actual project before they begin to go over it. A successful README.md file will explain things in a way that can be easily read and understood.

## Contributing

In all honesty I do not understand this part, do they want to know who contributed towards the completion of the project or links to the websites I may have used to get more information regarding the project?

## Questions

For further information please contact Salome Mphago at https://github.com/Saiishago . For the purpose of this project I will just use my contact information so a user/viewer has an idea of what to expect in this section of the file.
